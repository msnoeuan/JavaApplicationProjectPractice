I won't be what you want me to be, baby
I won't say what you want me to say
I'll be right here when you call my name, waiting
​
And when you tell me you don't want me here
And you, you keep my number 'til the rent check's clear
And my, my body starts burnin' up
​
And well, I don't want you anymore
So take the money and run to your man, I quit givin' a fuck
And well, I don't trust you anymore
So take the last train home in the dark
And quit breakin' my heart
​
I won't be what you want me to be, baby
I won't say what you want me to say
I think about you every night and day lately
​
And when you tell me you don't want me near
And I, I took to punchin' out your bathroom mirror again
It felt like losin' a friend
​
And well, I don't want you anymore
So take the money and run to your man, I quit givin' a fuck
And well, I don't trust you anymore
So take the last train home in the dark
And quit breakin' my heart
